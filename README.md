This is a project I did for a hackathon (solo) a few years ago.

I do intend to continue it* some time in the future. It will be completely rewritten, not even sure it will stay in this repo.

Front end only in this repo - the back end is a very basic PHP file with pre-coded stuffs. As hackathons go.

The project is a slick alternative to business cards, one that, in my opinion, trumps others.


* Possibly as something to get paid for, not sure / haven't decided on a model yet. Free stuff is fun, but I need to pay my rent somehow.
